## Unity C# Class

### What is this?
These are files for a Unity C# class for middle-school students.
We are developing a 2D Unity game with a stickman who can balance, walk, do a bunch of cool things and (most importantly) be affected by physics.

### How to download the game after a lesson:

1. Go to the top of the page and click the "Code" button.
2. Click on "Download ZIP". This will download a .zip file that contains all the game files up until the latest lesson.
3. Unzip the folder on your computer.
4. Find and open it with Unity Hub.

Ta-da, you're done!

Let me know if you have any questions during the class.
